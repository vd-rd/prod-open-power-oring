# PowerPath controller with HotSwap protection

This module is designed to provide redundant power supply for power rails between 5-36V. Depending on the components that are populated on the board it can deliver up to 40A of current. The module can be used in a standalone configuration (switches are provided to select desired functionality) or can be controlled using the 2.54 pin header.
